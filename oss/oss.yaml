      description: |
        Creates a bucket. 

        Buckets are virtual container within the Object Storage Service (OSS), which you can use to store and manage objects (files) in the cloud. The application creating the bucket is the owner of the bucket.

        **Note:** Do not use this operation to create buckets for BIM360 Document Management. Use [POST projects/{project_id}/storage](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-storage-POST>) instead. For details, see [Upload Files to BIM 360 Document Management](/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/document-management/upload-document).

        In addition to this operation that generates OSS signed URLs, OSS provides operations to generate S3 signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

        Only the application that owns the bucket containing the object can call this operation.

      summary: Replace Object Using Signed URL
      description: |
        Replaces an object that already exists on OSS, using an OSS signed URL. 

        The signed URL must fulfil the following conditions:

        - The signed URL is valid (it has not expired as yet).
        - It was generated with ``write`` or ``readwrite`` for the ``access`` parameter.

      summary: Generate Signed S3 Download URL
      description: |
        Gets a signed URL to download an object directly from S3, bypassing OSS servers. This signed URL expires in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start the download before the signed URL expires. The download itself can take longer. If the download fails after the validity period of the signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain a fresh signed URL.

        Only applications that have read access to the object can call this operation.   

        You can use range headers with the signed download URL to download the object in chunks. This ability lets you download chunks in parallel, which can result in faster downloads.

        If the object you want to download was uploaded in chunks and is still assembling on OSS, you will receive multiple S3 URLs instead of just one. Each URL will point to a chunk. If you prefer to receive a single URL, set the ``public-resource-fallback`` query parameter to ``true``. This setting will make OSS fallback to returning a single signed OSS URL, if assembling is still in progress. 

        In addition to this operation that generates S3 signed URLs, OSS provides an operation to generate OSS signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

        Creates and returns signed URLs to upload a set of objects directly to S3. These signed URLs expire in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start uploading the objects before the signed URLs expire. The upload  itself can take longer.

        Only the application that owns the bucket can call this operation. All other applications that call this operation will receive a "403 Forbidden" error.

        If required, you can request an array of signed URLs for each object, which lets you upload the objects in chunks. Once you upload all chunks you must call the [Complete Batch Upload to S3 Signed URL](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-batchcompleteupload-POST/) operation to indicate completion. This instructs OSS to assemble the chunks and reconstitute the object on OSS. You must call this operation even if you requested a single signed URL for an object.

        If an upload fails after the validity period of a signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain fresh signed URLs. However, you must use the same ``uploadKey`` that was returned when you originally called this operation.

      summary: Generate Signed S3 Upload URL
      description: |
        Gets a signed URL to upload an object directly to S3, bypassing OSS servers. You can also request an array of signed URLs which lets you upload an object in chunks.

        This signed URL expires in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start the upload before the signed URL expires. The upload itself can take longer. If the upload fails after the validity period of the signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain a fresh signed URL (or an array of signed URLs as the case may be). However, you must use the same ``uploadKey`` that was returned when you originally called this operation. 

        Only applications that own the bucket can call this operation.

        **Note:** Once you upload all chunks you must call the [Complete Upload to S3 Signed URL](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-POST/) operation to indicate completion. This instructs OSS to assemble the chunks and reconstitute the object on OSS. You must call this operation even when using a single signed URL. 

        In addition to this operation that generates S3 signed URLs, OSS provides an operation to generate OSS signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.
