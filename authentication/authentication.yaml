      summary: Authorize User
      description: |-
        Returns a browser URL to redirect an end user in order to acquire the user’s consent to authorize the application to access resources on their behalf.

        Invoking this operation is the first step in authenticating users and retrieving an authorization code grant. The authorization code that is generated remains valid for 5 minutes, while the ID token stays valid for 60 minutes. Any access tokens you obtain are valid for 60 minutes, and refresh tokens remain valid for 15 days.

        This operation has a rate limit of 500 calls per minute.

        **Note:** This operation is intended for use with client-side applications only. It is not suitable for server-side applications.

A fragment in a URI is the optional part of the URI that appears after a ``#`` symbol, which refers to a specific section within a resource. For example, ``section`` in ``https://www.mysite.org/myresource#section``.
            - ``form_post`` - Embed the authorization response parameter in an HTML form.
            - ``query`` -  Embed the authorization response as a query string parameter of the redirect URI. 

            If ``id_token`` is stated as ``response_type``,  only ``form_post`` is allowed as ``response_mode``.'
