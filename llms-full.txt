    get:
      summary: Authorize User
      description: |-
        Returns a browser URL to redirect an end user in order to acquire the user’s consent to authorize the application to access resources on their behalf.

        Invoking this operation is the first step in authenticating users and retrieving an authorization code grant. The authorization code that is generated remains valid for 5 minutes, while the ID token stays valid for 60 minutes. Any access tokens you obtain are valid for 60 minutes, and refresh tokens remain valid for 15 days.

        This operation has a rate limit of 500 calls per minute.

        **Note:** This operation is intended for use with client-side applications only. It is not suitable for server-side applications.

        - name: state
          in: query
          description: |
            A URL-encoded random string. The authorization flow will pass the same string back to the Callback URL using the ``state`` query string parameter. This process helps ensure that the callback you receive is a response to what you originally requested. It prevents malicious actors from forging requests.

            The string can only contain alphanumeric characters, commas, periods, underscores, and hyphens.

            Specifies how the authorization response should be returned. Valid values are:

            - ``fragment`` - Encode the response parameters in the fragment of the redirect URI. A fragment in a URI is the optional part of the URI that appears after a ``#`` symbol, which refers to a specific section within a resource. For example, ``section`` in ``https://www.mysite.org/myresource#section``.
            - ``form_post`` - Embed the authorization response parameter in an HTML form.
            - ``query`` -  Embed the authorization response as a query string parameter of the redirect URI. 

            If ``id_token`` is stated as ``response_type``,  only ``form_post`` is allowed as ``response_mode``.'

    A service account is an identity that an application can use to make API requests to other services without a user authorizing the requests. A service account is identified by a unique email address and has an Oxygen ID.

    A service account has one or more private keys. A private key is generated through an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; the paired public key is stored by Autodesk Identity.

    An application can use a service account's private key to generate a JWT token. The JWT token provides proof of implicit authentication and authorization for this service account; an application can exchange it for a three-legged access token for the service service.

    General error response from APIs:
    ```
    {
        "title:": "...",
        "detail": "..."
    }

      description: |-
        This API enables a [server-to-server application](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/App-types/Machine-to-machine/) to create a service account. 
        Additionally, an allowlisted Autodesk internal client can create a service account on behalf of a server-to-server application.
        To allowlist the client, please reach out to Identity team at [#oxygen](https://autodesk.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C075EFGET) slack channel for assistance.

        An application has up to 10 service accounts at any given time.

        The API requires a two-legged bearer token with the following scope:`application:service_account:write`.

      summary: Enable or Disable Service Account
      description: |-
        This API facilitates enabling and disabling of a service account.

        When a service account is disabled state, it loses its capability to manage its service account key. 
        Assertions signed by the key will be treated as invalid.

        This API allows to enable a service account that is in a deactivated state.

        The API requires a two-legged bearer token with the following scope:`application:service_account:write`.

        Errors:

      summary: Create Keys
      description: |-
        This API is used to create a service account key. 

        A service account key is a public-private key pair, generated using RSA with a key length of 2048 bits by the Identity Authorization Service (AuthZ).

        The private key is returned once during its creation. AuthZ only stores the public key.

        An service account has up to 3 keys at any given time.

        The API requires a two-legged bearer token with the following scope:`application:service_account_key:write`.

        The API returns the key in PEM format, as shown below


        ```
         ----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
         MIIEvgIBADANBg...

        Exchange a JWT assertion for access token by calling OAuth2 token management endpoint.


        The API is only for confidential clients, it requires Basic Authorization(clientId, client_secret), supporting the inclusion of auth information(client_id, client_secret) either in the header or the body, but not both simultaneously.

        JWT token signature will be generated by using RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-SIGN with the SHA-256 hash function with the private key for the following input content:

        {Base64url encoded header}.{Base64url encoded claim set}

        JWT assertion Claims:

        | claim name  | value               |

## Data Management ( directory listing ) and File ( versions / upload / download) APIs
# Data Management API
openapi: 3.0.1

  title: Data Management
  version: '1.0'
  description: |-
    The Data Management API provides a unified and consistent way to access data across BIM 360 Team, Fusion Team (formerly known as A360 Team), BIM 360 Docs, A360 Personal, and the Object Storage Service.

    With this API, you can accomplish a number of workflows, including accessing a Fusion model in Fusion Team and getting an ordered structure of items, IDs, and properties for generating a bill of materials in a 3rd-party process. Or, you might want to superimpose a Fusion model and a building model to use in the Viewer.

        Returns a collection of hubs that the user of your app can access.

        The returned hubs can be BIM 360 Team hubs, Fusion Team hubs (formerly known as A360 Team hubs), A360 Personal hubs, ACC Docs (Autodesk Docs) accounts, or BIM 360 Docs accounts. Only active hubs are returned.

        For BIM 360 Docs and ACC Docs, a hub ID corresponds to an Account ID. To convert a BIM 360 or ACC Account ID to a hub ID, prefix the Account ID with ``b.``. For example, an Account ID of ```c8b0c73d-3ae9``` translates to a hub ID of ``b.c8b0c73d-3ae9``.

        Renames, moves, hides, or unhides a folder. Marking a BIM 360 Docs folder as hidden effectively deletes it. You can restore it by changing its ``hidden`` attribute. You can also move BIM 360 Docs folders by changing their parent folder.

        You cannot permanently delete BIM 360 Docs folders. They are tagged as hidden folders and are removed from the BIM 360 Docs UI and from regular Data Management API responses. You can use the hidden filter (``filter[hidden]=true``) to get a list of deleted folders with the [List Folder Contents](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-folders-folder_id-contents-GET/) operation.

        Before you use the Data Management API to access BIM 360 Docs folders, provision your app through the BIM 360 Account Administrator portal. For details, see the [Manage Access to Docs tutorial](/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/getting-started/manage-access-to-docs/).

        Returns the resources (items, folders, and versions) that have a custom relationship with the specified folder. Custom relationships can be established between a folder and other resources within the data domain service (folders, items, and versions).

        Each relationship is defined by the id of the object at the other end of the relationship, together with type, attributes, and relationships links.
        Callers will typically use a filter parameter to restrict the response to the custom relationship types (``filter[meta.refType]``) they are interested in.

      summary: List Folder and Subfolder Contents
      description: |-
        Searches the specified folder and its subfolders and returns a list of the latest versions of the items you can access.


        Use the ``filter`` query string parameter to narrow down the list as appropriate. You can filter by the following properties of the version payload: 

        - ``type`` property, 
        - ``id`` property, 
        - any of the attributes object properties. 

        For example, you can filter by ``createTime`` and ``mimeType``. It returns tip versions (latest versions) of properties where the filter conditions are satisfied. To verify the properties of the attributes object for a specific version, use the [Get a Version](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-versions-version_id-GET/) operation.

        To list the immediate contents of the folder without parsing subfolders, use the [List Folder Contents](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-folders-folder_id-contents-GET/) operation.

        Creates the first version of a file (item). To create additional versions of an item, use POST versions.

        Before you create the first version of an item, you must create a placeholder for the file, and upload the file to the placeholder. For more details about the workflow, see the tutorial on uploading a file.

        This operation also allows you to create a new item by copying a specific version of an existing item to another folder. The copied version becomes the first version of the new item in the target folder.

        **Note:** You cannot copy versions of items across different projects and accounts.

        Use the [Create Version](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-versions-POST/) operation with the ``copyFrom`` parameter if you want to create a new version of an item by copying a specific version of another item. 

        Before you use the Data Management API to access BIM 360 Docs files, you must provision your app through the BIM 360 Account Administrator portal. For details, see the [Manage Access to Docs tutorial](/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/getting-started/manage-access-to-docs/).

            For information about managing and verifying folder permissions for BIM 360 Docs, see the section on [Managing Folder Permissions](http://help.autodesk.com/view/BIM360D/ENU/?guid=GUID-2643FEEF-B48A-45A1-B354-797DAD628C37).'

      description: |-
        Creates a new versions of an existing item.

        Before creating a new version you must create a storage location for the version in OSS, and upload the file to that location. For more details about the workflow, see the tutorial on uploading a file.

        This operation also allows you to create a new version of an item by copying a specific version of an existing item from another folder within the project. The new version becomes the tip version of the item.

        Use the [Create an Item](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-POST/) operation to copy a specific version of an existing item as a new item in another folder.

        This operation can also be used to delete files on BIM360 Document Management. For more information, please refer to the delete and restore a file tutorial.

        Before you use the Data Management API to access BIM 360 Docs files, you must provision your app through the BIM 360 Account Administrator portal. For details, see the [Manage Access to Docs tutorial](/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/getting-started/manage-access-to-docs/).

        **Note:** This operation supports Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) Projects. For more information, see the [ACC Platform API documentation](https://en.docs.acc.v1/overview/introduction/).

                            and not directly within the root folder. Permissions, visibility (e.g., ``items:autodesk.bim360:Document`` or ``items:autodesk.bim360:File``), 
                            and actions (e.g., OCR) are inherited from the existing parent folder. New folders also inherit subscriptions such as the 
                            notifications sent when files are added to a folder.

        The CheckPermission command checks if a user has permission to perform specified actions on specified resources.
        The user’s identity is derived from the ``x-user-id`` header (in a 2-Legged call), or from the access token (in a 3-Legged call). 

        See the [Developer's Guide topic on the CheckPermission command](/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/commands/checkpermission/) for more information.

        For BIM 360 Docs and ACC Docs, a hub ID corresponds to an Account ID. To convert a BIM 360 or ACC Account ID to a hub ID, prefix the Account ID with ``b.``. For example, an Account ID of ```c8b0c73d-3ae9``` translates to a hub ID of ``b.c8b0c73d-3ae9``.

        Similarly, to convert an ACC or BIM 360 project ID to a Data Management project ID prefix the ACC or BIM 360 project ID with ``b.``. For example, a project ID of ``c8b0c73d-3ae9`` translates to a project ID of ``b.c8b0c73d-3ae9``.

        The Version ID (URN) of the version to copy from. 

        **Note**: This parameter is relevant only for copying files to BIM 360 Docs.

        For information on how to find the URN, see the initial steps of the [Download a File](/en/docs/data/v2/tutorials/download-file/) tutorial.

        You can only copy files to the Plans folder or to subfolders of the Plans folder with an ``item:autodesk.bim360:Document`` item extension type. You can only copy files to the Project Files folder or to subfolders of the Project Files folder with an ``item:autodesk.bim360:File`` item extension type.  

        To verify an item’s extension type, use the [Get an Item](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-item_id-GET/) operation, and check the ``attributes.extension.type`` attribute.  

        Note that if you copy a file to the Plans folder or to a subfolder of the Plans folder, the copied file inherits the permissions of the source file. For example, if users of your app did not have permission to download files in the source folder, but does have permission to download files in the target folder, they will not be able to download the copied file.  

        Note that you cannot copy a file while it is being uploaded, updated, or copied. To verify the current process state of a file, call the [Get an Item](en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-item_id-GET/) operation , and check the ``attributes.extension.data.processState`` attribute.

      description: |
        Creates a bucket. 

        Buckets are virtual container within the Object Storage Service (OSS), which you can use to store and manage objects (files) in the cloud. The application creating the bucket is the owner of the bucket.

        **Note:** Do not use this operation to create buckets for BIM360 Document Management. Use [POST projects/{project_id}/storage](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-storage-POST>) instead. For details, see [Upload Files to BIM 360 Document Management](/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/document-management/upload-document).

        In addition to this operation that generates OSS signed URLs, OSS provides operations to generate S3 signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

      summary: Generate Signed S3 Download URL
      description: |
        Gets a signed URL to download an object directly from S3, bypassing OSS servers. This signed URL expires in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start the download before the signed URL expires. The download itself can take longer. If the download fails after the validity period of the signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain a fresh signed URL.

        Only applications that have read access to the object can call this operation.   

        You can use range headers with the signed download URL to download the object in chunks. This ability lets you download chunks in parallel, which can result in faster downloads.

        If the object you want to download was uploaded in chunks and is still assembling on OSS, you will receive multiple S3 URLs instead of just one. Each URL will point to a chunk. If you prefer to receive a single URL, set the ``public-resource-fallback`` query parameter to ``true``. This setting will make OSS fallback to returning a single signed OSS URL, if assembling is still in progress. 

        In addition to this operation that generates S3 signed URLs, OSS provides an operation to generate OSS signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

        Creates and returns signed URLs to upload a set of objects directly to S3. These signed URLs expire in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start uploading the objects before the signed URLs expire. The upload  itself can take longer.

        Only the application that owns the bucket can call this operation. All other applications that call this operation will receive a "403 Forbidden" error.

        If required, you can request an array of signed URLs for each object, which lets you upload the objects in chunks. Once you upload all chunks you must call the [Complete Batch Upload to S3 Signed URL](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-batchcompleteupload-POST/) operation to indicate completion. This instructs OSS to assemble the chunks and reconstitute the object on OSS. You must call this operation even if you requested a single signed URL for an object.

        If an upload fails after the validity period of a signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain fresh signed URLs. However, you must use the same ``uploadKey`` that was returned when you originally called this operation.

      summary: Generate Signed S3 Upload URL
      description: |
        Gets a signed URL to upload an object directly to S3, bypassing OSS servers. You can also request an array of signed URLs which lets you upload an object in chunks.

        This signed URL expires in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start the upload before the signed URL expires. The upload itself can take longer. If the upload fails after the validity period of the signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain a fresh signed URL (or an array of signed URLs as the case may be). However, you must use the same ``uploadKey`` that was returned when you originally called this operation. 

        Only applications that own the bucket can call this operation.

        **Note:** Once you upload all chunks you must call the [Complete Upload to S3 Signed URL](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-POST/) operation to indicate completion. This instructs OSS to assemble the chunks and reconstitute the object on OSS. You must call this operation even when using a single signed URL. 

        In addition to this operation that generates S3 signed URLs, OSS provides an operation to generate OSS signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

        Specifies what version of the Revit translator/extractor to use. Applicable only when the source design is of type RVT. Possible values are:

        - ``next`` - Makes the translation job use the newest available version of the translator/extractor. This option is meant to be used by beta testers who wish to test a pre-release version of the translator. If no pre-release version is available, the system uses the current official release version.
        - ``previous`` - Makes the translation job use the previous official release version of the translator/extractor. This option is meant to be used as a workaround in case of regressions caused by a new official release of the translator/extractor. If this attribute is not specified, the system uses the current official release version.

        - ``Classic`` - (Default) Uses hardcoded rules to set the hierarchy of items.
        - ``SystemPath`` - Uses a linked XML or MDB2 properties file to set hierarchy of items. You can use this option to make the organization of items consistent with SmartPlant 3D.

        **Notes:**

        1. The functioning of the SystemPath depends on the default setting of the property SP3D_SystemPath or System Path.
        2. The pathing delimiter must be \.
        3. If you want to customize further, import the VUE file to Navisworks. After that, use POST job on the resulting Navisworks (nwc/nwd) file.

The second element of the array must be the value to match. If the first element is ``name``, must be a string value. If the first element is a numerical property, must be a numeric.

        Returns a list of properties of all objects in the  Model View specified by the ``modelGuid`` parameter. 

        This operation returns properties of all objects by default. However, you can restrict the results to a specific object by specifying its ID as the ``objectid`` parameter.

        Properties are returned as a flat list, ordered, by their ``objectid``. The ``objectid`` is a non-persistent ID assigned to an object when the source design is translated to the SVF or SVF2 format. This means that:

        - A design file must be translated to SVF or SVF2 before you can retrieve properties.
        - The ``objectid`` of an object can change if the design is translated to SVF or SVF2 again. If you require a persistent ID across translations, use ``externalId`` to reference objects, instead of ``objectid``.

        Before you call this operation:

        - Use the `List Model Views </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/metadata/urn-metadata-GET/>`_ operation to obtain the list of Model Views (Viewables) in the source design. 
        - Pick the ID of the Model View you want to query and specify that ID as the value for the ``modelGuid`` parameter.

        **Tip**: Use `Fetch Specific Properties </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/metadata/urn-metadata-guid-properties-query-POST/>`_ to retrieve only the objects and properties of interest. What’s more, the response is paginated. So, when the number of properties returned is large, responses start arriving more promptly.

        Retrieves the manifest of the specified source design.

        The manifest is a JSON file containing information about all the derivatives translated from the specified source design. It contains information such as the URNs of the derivatives, the translation status of each derivative, and much more.

        The first time you translate a source design, the Model Derivative service creates a manifest for that design. Thereafter, every time you translate that source design, even to a different format, the Model Derivative service updates the same manifest. It does not create a new manifest. Instead, the manifest acts like a central registry for all the derivatives of your source design created through the Model Derivative service.  

        When the Model Derivative service starts a translation job (as a result of a request you make using `Create Translation Job </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/jobs/job-POST/>`_), it keeps on updating the manifest at regular intervals. So, you can use the manifest to check the status and progress of each derivative that is being generated. When multiple derivatives have been requested each derivative may complete at a different time. So, each derivative has its own ``status`` attribute. The manifest also contains an overall ``status`` attribute. The overall ``status`` becomes ``complete`` when the ``status`` of all individual derivatives become complete.

        Once the translation status of a derivative is ``complete`` you can download the derivative.

        **Note:** You cannot download 3D SVF2 derivatives.

        Creates a job to translate the specified source design to another format, generating derivatives of the source design. You can optionally:

        - Extract selected parts of a design and export the set of geometries in OBJ format.
        - Generate different-sized thumbnails.

        When the translation job runs, details about the process and generated derivatives are logged to a JSON file known as a manifest. This manifest is typically created during the first translation of a source design. Subsequently, the system updates the same manifest whenever a translation is performed for that design. 

        If necessary, you can set the ``x-ads-force`` parameter to ``true``. Then, the system will delete the existing manifest and create a new one. However, be aware that doing so will also delete all previously generated derivatives.

## Webhooks v2 Platform Integration
# Webhooks API
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Webhooks
  version: '1.0'
  description: |
    The Webhooks API enables applications to listen to APS events and receive notifications when they occur. When an event is triggered, the Webhooks service sends a notification to a callback URL you have defined.
    You can customize the types of events and resources for which you receive notifications. For example, you can set up a webhook to send notifications when files are modified or deleted in a specified hub or project.
    Below is quick summary of this workflow:
    1. Identify the data for which you want to receive notifications.
    2. Use the Webhooks API to create one or more hooks.
    3. The Webhooks service will notify the webhook when there is a change in the data.

        Sets a secret token to verify the authenticity of webhook payloads. 

        When a webhook event occurs, the service calculates a hash signature using the token and includes it in the event notification. The receiving application listening at the callback URL can verify the payload's integrity by comparing the calculated signature to the one received.

        The webhooks affected by this operation are determined by the type of access token you use.

        - Two-legged Access Token: Sets the secret token for all webhooks owned by calling the app.
        - Three-legged Access Token: Sets the secret token for all webhooks owned by the calling user

        **Note:** Use the [Update Webhook operation](/en/docs/webhooks/v1/reference/http/webhooks/systems-system-events-event-hooks-hook_id-PATCH/) to set a token for a specific webhook.

        - ``EMEA`` - Data center dedicated to serve the European Union, Middle East, and Africa regions.
        - ``APAC`` - (Beta) Data center dedicated to serve the Australia region.

        **Note:** 

        1. Beta features are subject to change. Please avoid using them in production environments.
        2. You can also use the ``region`` query string parameter to specify the region. If you specify the ``region`` query string parameter as well as the ``x-ads-region`` header, the ``x-ads-region`` header takes precedence.
