    The Webhooks API enables applications to listen to APS events and receive notifications when they occur. When an event is triggered, the Webhooks service sends a notification to a callback URL you have defined.
    You can customize the types of events and resources for which you receive notifications. For example, you can set up a webhook to send notifications when files are modified or deleted in a specified hub or project.
    Below is quick summary of this workflow:
    1. Identify the data for which you want to receive notifications.
    2. Use the Webhooks API to create one or more hooks.
    3. The Webhooks service will notify the webhook when there is a change in the data.

        Sets a secret token to verify the authenticity of webhook payloads. 

        When a webhook event occurs, the service calculates a hash signature using the token and includes it in the event notification. The receiving application listening at the callback URL can verify the payload's integrity by comparing the calculated signature to the one received.

        The webhooks affected by this operation are determined by the type of access token you use.

        - Two-legged Access Token: Sets the secret token for all webhooks owned by calling the app.
        - Three-legged Access Token: Sets the secret token for all webhooks owned by the calling user

        **Note:** Use the [Update Webhook operation](/en/docs/webhooks/v1/reference/http/webhooks/systems-system-events-event-hooks-hook_id-PATCH/) to set a token for a specific webhook.


        See the [Secret Token](/en/docs/webhooks/v1/developers_guide/basics/#secret-token) section in API Basics for more information.

        Note that there can be a delay of up to 10 minutes while the change takes effect. We recommend that your callback accept both secret token values for a period of time to allow all requests to go through.

      description: |-
        Removes an existing secret token from the webhooks impacted by this operation. 

        The webhooks affected by this operation are determined by the type of access token you use.

        - Two-legged Access Token: Sets the secret token for all webhooks owned by calling the app.
        - Three-legged Access Token: Sets the secrety token for all webhooks owned by the calling user

        Note that there can be a delay of up to 10 minutes while the change takes effect. We recommend that your callback accept both secret token values for a period of time to allow all requests to go through.

        See the [Secret Token](/en/docs/webhooks/v1/developers_guide/basics/#secret-token) section in API Basics for more information.
