        Specifies what Object IDs to return, if the design has legacy SVF derivatives generated by the BIM Docs service. Possible values are:  

        - ``latest`` - (Default) Return SVF2 Object IDs. 
        - ``fallback`` - Return SVF Object IDs.  

        **Note:**  

        1. This parameter applies only to designs with legacy SVF derivatives generated by the BIM 360 Docs service. 
        2. The BIM 360 Docs service now generates SVF2 derivatives. SVF2 Object IDs may not be compatible with the SVF Object IDs previously generated by the BIM 360 Docs service. Setting this header to fallback may resolve backward compatibility issues resulting from Object IDs of legacy SVF derivatives being retained on the client side. 
        3. If you use this parameter with one derivative (URN), you must use it consistently across the following:

        Specifies what version of the Revit translator/extractor to use. Applicable only when the source design is of type RVT. Possible values are:

        - ``next`` - Makes the translation job use the newest available version of the translator/extractor. This option is meant to be used by beta testers who wish to test a pre-release version of the translator. If no pre-release version is available, the system uses the current official release version.
        - ``previous`` - Makes the translation job use the previous official release version of the translator/extractor. This option is meant to be used as a workaround in case of regressions caused by a new official release of the translator/extractor. If this attribute is not specified, the system uses the current official release version.

        - ``Classic`` - (Default) Uses hardcoded rules to set the hierarchy of items.
        - ``SystemPath`` - Uses a linked XML or MDB2 properties file to set hierarchy of items. You can use this option to make the organization of items consistent with SmartPlant 3D.

        **Notes:**

        1. The functioning of the SystemPath depends on the default setting of the property SP3D_SystemPath or System Path.
        2. The pathing delimiter must be \.
        3. If you want to customize further, import the VUE file to Navisworks. After that, use POST job on the resulting Navisworks (nwc/nwd) file.

            Master views are 3D views that are generated for each phase of the Revit model. A master view contains all elements (including “room” elements) present in the host model for that phase. The display name of a master view defaults to the name of the phase it is generated from. However, if a view with that name already exists, the Model Derivative service appends a suffix to the default display name.

            1. Master views do not contain elements from linked models.
            2. Enabling this option can increase the time it takes to translate the model.

            The first element of the array contains the name of the attribute. This can be the ``name`` attribute or the name of a numerical property. The second element of the array must be the value to match. If the first element is ``name``, must be a string value. If the first element is a numerical property, must be a numeric. The array can only be two elements long.

            For example, if you specify an array as: ``"$eq":["name","Rectangular"]``, the request will only return the properties of the object named ``Rectangular``. if you specify an array as: ``"$eq":["properties.Dimensions.Width1",0.6]``, the request will return the properties of all objects whose ``properties.Dimensions.Width1`` property is exactly equal to ``0.6``.

            **Note:** We recommend that you  use ``$between``  instead of ``$eq`` when testing non-integer numeric values for equality. Using ``between`` mitigates floating-point errors.

            **Note:** The Model Derivative service converts numeric values from their native units to metric base units for comparison. So, you must specify the values to compare with in metric base units. For example, if the property you are comparing is a length measurement, you must specify the values  in ``m``.

        Returns a list of properties of all objects in the  Model View specified by the ``modelGuid`` parameter. 

        This operation returns properties of all objects by default. However, you can restrict the results to a specific object by specifying its ID as the ``objectid`` parameter.

        Properties are returned as a flat list, ordered, by their ``objectid``. The ``objectid`` is a non-persistent ID assigned to an object when the source design is translated to the SVF or SVF2 format. This means that:

        - A design file must be translated to SVF or SVF2 before you can retrieve properties.
        - The ``objectid`` of an object can change if the design is translated to SVF or SVF2 again. If you require a persistent ID across translations, use ``externalId`` to reference objects, instead of ``objectid``.

        Before you call this operation:

        - Use the `List Model Views </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/metadata/urn-metadata-GET/>`_ operation to obtain the list of Model Views (Viewables) in the source design. 
        - Pick the ID of the Model View you want to query and specify that ID as the value for the ``modelGuid`` parameter.

        **Tip**: Use `Fetch Specific Properties </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/metadata/urn-metadata-guid-properties-query-POST/>`_ to retrieve only the objects and properties of interest. What’s more, the response is paginated. So, when the number of properties returned is large, responses start arriving more promptly.

        Retrieves the manifest of the specified source design.

        The manifest is a JSON file containing information about all the derivatives translated from the specified source design. It contains information such as the URNs of the derivatives, the translation status of each derivative, and much more.

        The first time you translate a source design, the Model Derivative service creates a manifest for that design. Thereafter, every time you translate that source design, even to a different format, the Model Derivative service updates the same manifest. It does not create a new manifest. Instead, the manifest acts like a central registry for all the derivatives of your source design created through the Model Derivative service.  

        When the Model Derivative service starts a translation job (as a result of a request you make using `Create Translation Job </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/jobs/job-POST/>`_), it keeps on updating the manifest at regular intervals. So, you can use the manifest to check the status and progress of each derivative that is being generated. When multiple derivatives have been requested each derivative may complete at a different time. So, each derivative has its own ``status`` attribute. The manifest also contains an overall ``status`` attribute. The overall ``status`` becomes ``complete`` when the ``status`` of all individual derivatives become complete.

        Once the translation status of a derivative is ``complete`` you can download the derivative.

        **Note:** You cannot download 3D SVF2 derivatives.

        Deletes the manifest of the specified source design. It also deletes all derivatives (translated output files) generated from the source design. However, it does not delete the source design.

        **Note:** This operation is idempotent. So, if you call it multiple times, even when no manifest exists, will still return a successful response (200).

      description: |-
        Creates a job to translate the specified source design to another format, generating derivatives of the source design. You can optionally:

        - Extract selected parts of a design and export the set of geometries in OBJ format.
        - Generate different-sized thumbnails.

        When the translation job runs, details about the process and generated derivatives are logged to a JSON file known as a manifest. This manifest is typically created during the first translation of a source design. Subsequently, the system updates the same manifest whenever a translation is performed for that design. 

        If necessary, you can set the ``x-ads-force`` parameter to ``true``. Then, the system will delete the existing manifest and create a new one. However, be aware that doing so will also delete all previously generated derivatives.
