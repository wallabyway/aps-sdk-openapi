    The Data Management API provides a unified and consistent way to access data across BIM 360 Team, Fusion Team (formerly known as A360 Team), BIM 360 Docs, A360 Personal, and the Object Storage Service.

    With this API, you can accomplish a number of workflows, including accessing a Fusion model in Fusion Team and getting an ordered structure of items, IDs, and properties for generating a bill of materials in a 3rd-party process. Or, you might want to superimpose a Fusion model and a building model to use in the Viewer.

      description: |-
        Returns a collection of hubs that the user of your app can access.

        The returned hubs can be BIM 360 Team hubs, Fusion Team hubs (formerly known as A360 Team hubs), A360 Personal hubs, ACC Docs (Autodesk Docs) accounts, or BIM 360 Docs accounts. Only active hubs are returned.

        For BIM 360 Docs and ACC Docs, a hub ID corresponds to an Account ID. To convert a BIM 360 or ACC Account ID to a hub ID, prefix the Account ID with ``b.``. For example, an Account ID of ```c8b0c73d-3ae9``` translates to a hub ID of ``b.c8b0c73d-3ae9``.

        Renames, moves, hides, or unhides a folder. Marking a BIM 360 Docs folder as hidden effectively deletes it. You can restore it by changing its ``hidden`` attribute. You can also move BIM 360 Docs folders by changing their parent folder.

        You cannot permanently delete BIM 360 Docs folders. They are tagged as hidden folders and are removed from the BIM 360 Docs UI and from regular Data Management API responses. You can use the hidden filter (``filter[hidden]=true``) to get a list of deleted folders with the [List Folder Contents](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-folders-folder_id-contents-GET/) operation.

        Before you use the Data Management API to access BIM 360 Docs folders, provision your app through the BIM 360 Account Administrator portal. For details, see the [Manage Access to Docs tutorial](/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/getting-started/manage-access-to-docs/).

      summary: List Folder and Subfolder Contents
      description: |-
        Searches the specified folder and its subfolders and returns a list of the latest versions of the items you can access.


        Use the ``filter`` query string parameter to narrow down the list as appropriate. You can filter by the following properties of the version payload: 

        - ``type`` property, 
        - ``id`` property, 
        - any of the attributes object properties. 

        For example, you can filter by ``createTime`` and ``mimeType``. It returns tip versions (latest versions) of properties where the filter conditions are satisfied. To verify the properties of the attributes object for a specific version, use the [Get a Version](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-versions-version_id-GET/) operation.

        To list the immediate contents of the folder without parsing subfolders, use the [List Folder Contents](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-folders-folder_id-contents-GET/) operation.

        **Note:** This operation supports Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) Projects. For more information, see the [ACC Platform API documentation](https://en.docs.acc.v1/overview/introduction/).

        This operation also allows you to create a new item by copying a specific version of an existing item to another folder. The copied version becomes the first version of the new item in the target folder.

        **Note:** You cannot copy versions of items across different projects and accounts.

        Use the [Create Version](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-versions-POST/) operation with the ``copyFrom`` parameter if you want to create a new version of an item by copying a specific version of another item. 

        Before you use the Data Management API to access BIM 360 Docs files, you must provision your app through the BIM 360 Account Administrator portal. For details, see the [Manage Access to Docs tutorial](/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/getting-started/manage-access-to-docs/).

        Before creating a new version you must create a storage location for the version in OSS, and upload the file to that location. For more details about the workflow, see the tutorial on uploading a file.

        This operation also allows you to create a new version of an item by copying a specific version of an existing item from another folder within the project. The new version becomes the tip version of the item.

        Use the [Create an Item](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-POST/) operation to copy a specific version of an existing item as a new item in another folder.

        This operation can also be used to delete files on BIM360 Document Management. For more information, please refer to the delete and restore a file tutorial.

                            Note that for BIM 360 Docs, new folders must be created within an existing folder (e.g., the Plans or Project Files folders), 
                            and not directly within the root folder. Permissions, visibility (e.g., ``items:autodesk.bim360:Document`` or ``items:autodesk.bim360:File``), 
                            and actions (e.g., OCR) are inherited from the existing parent folder. New folders also inherit subscriptions such as the 
                            notifications sent when files are added to a folder.

        The CheckPermission command checks if a user has permission to perform specified actions on specified resources.
        The user’s identity is derived from the ``x-user-id`` header (in a 2-Legged call), or from the access token (in a 3-Legged call). 

        See the [Developer's Guide topic on the CheckPermission command](/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/commands/checkpermission/) for more information.

        In the event of a ``NON_CONFORMING`` status, use the [Get a Folder](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-folders-folder_id-GET) operation to get the file naming standards IDs that have been applied to the version's parent folder. Then use the ID to call [GET naming-standards](/en/docs/bim360/v1/reference/http/document-management-naming-standards-id-GET/) to get the details of the file naming standard.

        Note that this feature is only available for BIM 360 projects.          

        To learn more about the file naming standard feature, see the [BIM 360 File Naming Standard](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BIM360D/ENU/?guid=Common_Data_Environment) help documentation.

        For BIM 360 Docs and ACC Docs, a hub ID corresponds to an Account ID. To convert a BIM 360 or ACC Account ID to a hub ID, prefix the Account ID with ``b.``. For example, an Account ID of ```c8b0c73d-3ae9``` translates to a hub ID of ``b.c8b0c73d-3ae9``.

        Similarly, to convert an ACC or BIM 360 project ID to a Data Management project ID prefix the ACC or BIM 360 project ID with ``b.``. For example, a project ID of ``c8b0c73d-3ae9`` translates to a project ID of ``b.c8b0c73d-3ae9``.

        The Version ID (URN) of the version to copy from. 

        **Note**: This parameter is relevant only for copying files to BIM 360 Docs.

        For information on how to find the URN, see the initial steps of the [Download a File](/en/docs/data/v2/tutorials/download-file/) tutorial.

        You can only copy files to the Plans folder or to subfolders of the Plans folder with an ``item:autodesk.bim360:Document`` item extension type. You can only copy files to the Project Files folder or to subfolders of the Project Files folder with an ``item:autodesk.bim360:File`` item extension type.  

        To verify an item’s extension type, use the [Get an Item](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-item_id-GET/) operation, and check the ``attributes.extension.type`` attribute.  

        Note that if you copy a file to the Plans folder or to a subfolder of the Plans folder, the copied file inherits the permissions of the source file. For example, if users of your app did not have permission to download files in the source folder, but does have permission to download files in the target folder, they will not be able to download the copied file.  

        Note that you cannot copy a file while it is being uploaded, updated, or copied. To verify the current process state of a file, call the [Get an Item](en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-item_id-GET/) operation , and check the ``attributes.extension.data.processState`` attribute.
