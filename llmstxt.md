# Autodesk Platform Services APIs overview

### Construction.Issues
An issue is an item that is created in ACC for tracking, managing and communicating tasks, problems and other points of concern through to resolution. You can manage different types of issues, such as design, safety, and commissioning. We currently support issues that are associated with a project.

### Account Admin
The Account Admin API automates creating and managing projects, assigning and managing project users, and managing member and partner company directories. You can also synchronize data with external systems.

### Authentication
OAuth2 token management APIs.

### Data Management API
The Data Management API provides a unified and consistent way to access data across BIM 360 Team, Fusion Team (formerly known as A360 Team), BIM 360 Docs, A360 Personal, and the Object Storage Service. With this API, you can accomplish a number of workflows, including accessing a Fusion model in Fusion Team and getting an ordered structure of items, IDs, and properties for generating a bill of materials in a 3rd-party process. Or, you might want to superimpose a Fusion model and a building model to use in the Viewer.

### Model Derivative
Use the Model Derivative API to translate designs from one CAD format to another.

### oss
The Object Storage Service (OSS) allows your application to download and upload raw files (such as PDF, XLS, DWG, or RVT) that are managed by the Data service.

### Secure Service Account (SSA)
APIs to manage Service accounts and keys. A service account is an identity that an application can use to make API requests to other services without a user authorizing the requests. A service account is identified by a unique email address and has an Oxygen ID. A service account has one or more private keys. A private key is generated through an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; the paired public key is stored by Autodesk Identity. An application can use a service account's private key to generate a JWT token. The JWT token provides proof of implicit authentication and authorization for this service account; an application can exchange it for a three-legged access token for the service service. General error response from APIs: ``` { "title:": "...", "detail": "..." } ```

### Webhooks
The Webhooks API enables applications to listen to APS events and receive notifications when they occur. When an event is triggered, the Webhooks service sends a notification to a callback URL you have defined. You can customize the types of events and resources for which you receive notifications. For example, you can set up a webhook to send notifications when files are modified or deleted in a specified hub or project. Below is quick summary of this workflow: 1. Identify the data for which you want to receive notifications. 2. Use the Webhooks API to create one or more hooks. 3. The Webhooks service will notify the webhook when there is a change in the data.

- `Region` in `header` (required: False) — The region where the bucket resides. Acceptable values: US, EMEA.
- `User-Id` in `header` (required: False) — Note that this header is not relevant for Account Admin GET endpoints. The ID of a user on whose behalf your API request is acting. Required if you’re using a 2-legged authentication context, which must be 2-legged OAuth2 security with user impersonation.  Your app has access to all users specified by the administrator in the SaaS integrations UI. Provide this header value to identify the user to be affected by the request.  You can use either the user’s ACC ID (id), or their Autodesk ID (autodeskId).
- `filter[products]` in `query` (required: False) — A comma-separated list of the products that the returned projects must use. Only projects that use one or more of the listed products are returned.
- `filter[name]` in `query` (required: False) — A user name or name pattern to filter users by. Can be a partial match based on the value of filterTextMatch that you provide; for example: filter[name]=ABCco filterTextMatch=startsWith.  Max length: 255
- `filter[email]` in `query` (required: False) — A user email address or address pattern that the returned users must have. This can be a partial match based on the value of filterTextMatch that you provide. For example:  filter[email]=sample filterTextMatch=startsWith  Max length: 255

- `filter[id]` in `query` (required: False) — A list of the ACC IDs of users to retrieve.
- `filter[roleId]` in `query` (required: False) — The ID of a user role that the returned users must have. To obtain a role ID for this filter, you can inspect the roleId field in previous responses to this endpoint or to the GET projects/:projectId/users/:userId endpoint.  Max length: 255
- `filter[roleIds]` in `query` (required: False) — A list of the IDs of user roles that the returned users must have. To obtain a role ID for this filter, you can inspect the roleId field in previous responses to this endpoint or to the GET projects/:projectId/users/:userId endpoint.
- `sort` in `query` (required: False) — A list of fields to sort the returned users by. Multiple sort fields are applied in sequence order — each sort field produces groupings of projects with the same values of that field; the next sort field applies within the groupings produced by the previous sort field.

- `orFilters` in `query` (required: False) — A list of user fields to combine with the SQL OR operator for filtering the returned project users. The OR is automatically incorporated between the fields; any one of them can produce a valid match.
- `filterTextMatch` in `query` (required: False) — When filtering on a text-based field, this value indicates how to do the matching. Default value: contains. Possible values: contains, startsWith, endsWith and equals.
- `limit` in `query` (required: False) — The maximum number of records to return in a single request. Possible range: 1-200. Default value: 20.
- `offset` in `query` (required: False) — The record number that the returned page should start with. When the total number of records exceeds the value of limit, increase the offset value in subsequent requests to continue getting the remaining results.

### Authorize User

**Endpoint:** `GET /authentication/v2/authorize`
**Operation ID:** `authorize`

#### Description
Returns a browser URL to redirect an end user in order to acquire the user’s consent to authorize the application to access resources on their behalf.

Invoking this operation is the first step in authenticating users and retrieving an authorization code grant. The authorization code that is generated remains valid for 5 minutes, while the ID token stays valid for 60 minutes. Any access tokens you obtain are valid for 60 minutes, and refresh tokens remain valid for 15 days.

This operation has a rate limit of 500 calls per minute.

**Note:** This operation is intended for use with client-side applications only. It is not suitable for server-side applications.

#### Parameters
- `client_id` in `query` (required: True) — The Client ID of the calling application, as registered with APS.
- `response_type` in `query` (required: True) — The type of response you want to receive. Possible values are: 

-  ``code`` - Authorization code grant.
-  ``id_token`` - OpenID Connect ID token.
- `redirect_uri` in `query` (required: True) — The URI that APS redirects users to after they grant or deny access permission to the application. Must match the Callback URL for the application as registered with APS.

Must be specified as a URL-safe string. It can include query parameters or any other valid URL construct.
- `nonce` in `query` (required: False) — A random string that is sent with the request. APS passes back the same string to you so that you can verify whether you received the same string that you sent. This check mitigates token replay attacks
- `state` in `query` (required: False) — A URL-encoded random string. The authorization flow will pass the same string back to the Callback URL using the ``state`` query string parameter. This process helps ensure that the callback you receive is a response to what you originally requested. It prevents malicious actors from forging requests.

The string can only contain alphanumeric characters, commas, periods, underscores, and hyphens.
- `scope` in `query` (required: False) — A URL-encoded space-delimited list of requested scopes. See the `Developer's Guide documentation on scopes </en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/scopes/>`_ for a list of valid values you can provide.

The string you specify for this parameter must not exceed 2000 characters and it cannot contain more than 50 scopes.
- `response_mode` in `query` (required: False) — Specifies how the authorization response should be returned. Valid values are:

- ``fragment`` - Encode the response parameters in the fragment of the redirect URI. A fragment in a URI is the optional part of the URI that appears after a ``#`` symbol, which refers to a specific section within a resource. For example, ``section`` in ``https://www.mysite.org/myresource#section``.
- ``form_post`` - Embed the authorization response parameter in an HTML form.
- ``query`` -  Embed the authorization response as a query string parameter of the redirect URI. 

If ``id_token`` is stated as ``response_type``,  only ``form_post`` is allowed as ``response_mode``.'
- `prompt` in `query` (required: False) — Specifies how to prompt users for authentication. Possible values are: 

- ``login`` : Always prompt the user for authentication, regardless of the state of the login session. 

**Note:** If you do not specify this parameter, the system will not prompt the user for authentication as long as a login session is active. If a login session is not active, the system will prompt the user for authentication.
- `authoptions` in `query` (required: False) — A JSON object containing options that specify how to display the sign-in page. Refer the `Developer's Guide documentation on AuthOptions </en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/authoptions/>`_ for supported values.
- `code_challenge` in `query` (required: False) — A URL-encoded string derived from the code verifier sent in the authorization request with the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant flow.
- `code_challenge_method` in `query` (required: False) — The method used to derive the code challenge for the PKCE grant flow. Possible value is:

- ``S256``- Hashes the code verifier using the SHA-256 algorithm and then applies Base64 URL encoding.

#### Responses
- **302**: Successfully redirected to the redirect URI.

### Fetch Object tree

**Endpoint:** `GET /modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/metadata/{modelGuid}`
**Operation ID:** `get-object-tree`

#### Description
Retrieves the structured hierarchy of objects, known as an object tree, from the specified Model View (Viewable) within the specified source design. The object tree represents the arrangement and relationships of various objects present in that Model View.

**Note:** A design file must be translated to SVF or SVF2 before you can retrieve its object tree.  

Before you call this operation:

- Use the `List Model Views </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/metadata/urn-metadata-GET/>`_ operation to obtain the list of Model Views in the source design.
- Pick the ID of the Model View you want to query and specify that ID as the value for the ``modelGuid``  parameter.

#### Parameters
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/accept-encoding`
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/x-ads-force`
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/x-ads-derivative-format`
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/forceget`
- `objectid` in `query` (required: False) — If specified, retrieves the sub-tree that has the specified object ID as its parent node. If this parameter is not specified, retrieves the entire object tree.
- `level` in `query` (required: False) — Specifies how many child levels of the hierarchy to return, when the ``objectid``  parameter is specified. Currently supports only ``level`` = ``1``.

#### Responses
- **200**: Success
- **202**: Request accepted but processing not complete. Call this operation iteratively until a 200 is returned.

### Fetch All Properties

**Endpoint:** `GET /modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/metadata/{modelGuid}/properties`
**Operation ID:** `get-all-properties`

#### Description
Returns a list of properties of all objects in the  Model View specified by the ``modelGuid`` parameter. 

This operation returns properties of all objects by default. However, you can restrict the results to a specific object by specifying its ID as the ``objectid`` parameter.

Properties are returned as a flat list, ordered, by their ``objectid``. The ``objectid`` is a non-persistent ID assigned to an object when the source design is translated to the SVF or SVF2 format. This means that:

- A design file must be translated to SVF or SVF2 before you can retrieve properties.
- The ``objectid`` of an object can change if the design is translated to SVF or SVF2 again. If you require a persistent ID across translations, use ``externalId`` to reference objects, instead of ``objectid``.

Before you call this operation:

- Use the `List Model Views </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/metadata/urn-metadata-GET/>`_ operation to obtain the list of Model Views (Viewables) in the source design. 
- Pick the ID of the Model View you want to query and specify that ID as the value for the ``modelGuid`` parameter.

**Tip**: Use `Fetch Specific Properties </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/metadata/urn-metadata-guid-properties-GET/>`_ to retrieve only the objects and properties of interest. What’s more, the response is paginated. So, when the number of properties returned is large, responses start arriving more promptly.

#### Parameters
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/accept-encoding`
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/x-ads-force`
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/x-ads-derivative-format`
- `objectid` in `query` (required: False) — The Object ID of the object you want to restrict the response to. If you do not specify this parameter, all properties of all objects within the Model View are returned.
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/forceget`

#### Responses
- **200**: Success.
- **202**: Request accepted but processing not complete. Call this operation again, until you recieve 200 OK.

### Fetch Derivative Download URL

**Endpoint:** `GET /modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/manifest/{derivativeUrn}/signedcookies`
**Operation ID:** `get-derivative-url`

#### Description
Returns a download URL and a set of signed cookies, which lets you securely download the derivative specified by the `derivativeUrn` URI parameter. The signed cookies have a lifetime of 6 hours. Although you cannot use range headers for this operation, you can use range headers for the returned download URL to download the derivative in chunks, in parallel.

#### Parameters
- `minutes-expiration` in `query` (required: False) — Specifies how many minutes the signed cookies should remain valid. Default value is 360 minutes. The value you specify must be lower than the default value for this parameter. If you specify a value greater than the default value, the Model Derivative service will return an error with an HTTP status code of 400.
- `response-content-disposition` in `query` (required: False) — The value that must be returned with the download URL as the ``response-content-disposition`` query string parameter. Must begin with ``attachment``. This value defaults to the default value corresponding to the derivative/file.

#### Responses
- **200**: Success

### Check Derivative Details

**Endpoint:** `HEAD /modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/manifest/{derivativeUrn}`
**Operation ID:** `head-check-derivative`

#### Description
Returns information about the specified derivative.

This operation returns a set of headers similar to that returned by `Download Derivative </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/urn-manifest-derivativeurn-GET>`_.

You can use this operation to determine the total content length of a derivative before you download it. If the derivative is large, you can choose to download the derivative in chunks, by specifying a chunk size using the Range header parameter.

#### Responses
- **200**: Success
- **202**: Request accepted but processing not complete. Call this operation again, until getting 200 OK.

---

### Fetch Manifest

**Endpoint:** `GET /modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/manifest`
**Operation ID:** `get-manifest`

#### Description
Retrieves the manifest of the specified source design.

The manifest is a JSON file containing information about all the derivatives translated from the specified source design. It contains information such as the URNs of the derivatives, the translation status of each derivative, and much more.

The first time you translate a source design, the Model Derivative service creates a manifest for that source design. Thereafter, every time you translate that source design, even to a different format, the Model Derivative service updates that manifest. It does not create a new manifest. Instead, it keeps track of all derivatives of that design.  

When the Model Derivative service starts a translation job (as a result of a request you make using `Submit Translation Job </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/jobs/job-POST/>`_), it keeps on updating the manifest at regular intervals. So, you can use the manifest to check the status and progress of each derivative that is being generated. When multiple derivatives have been requested each derivative may complete at a different time. So, each derivative has its own ``status`` attribute. The manifest also contains an overall ``status`` attribute. The overall ``status`` becomes ``complete`` when the ``status`` of all individual derivatives become complete.

Once the translation status of a derivative is ``complete`` you can download the URN.

**Note**: You cannot download 3D SVF2 derivatives.

#### Parameters
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/accept-encoding`

#### Responses
- **200**: Success

---

### Delete Manifest

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/manifest`
**Operation ID:** `delete-manifest`

#### Description
Deletes the manifest of the specified source design. It also deletes all derivatives (translated output files) generated from the source design. However, it does not delete the source design.

**Note:** This operation is idempotent. So, if you call it multiple times, even when no manifest exists, will still return a successful response (200).

#### Responses
- **200**: Success.

---

### Submit Translation Job

**Endpoint:** `POST /modelderivative/v2/designdata/job`
**Operation ID:** `start-job`

#### Description
Creates a job to translate the specified source design to another format, generating derivatives of the source design. You can optionaly:

- Extract selected parts of a design and export the set of geometries in OBJ format.
- Generate different-sized thumbnails.

When the translation job runs, progress information and details of the generated derivatives are logged to a JSON file that is called a manifest. A manifest is typically created the first time you translate the source design. Thereafter the system updates the same manifest each time a translation job is executed for that source design. If necessary, you can set the ``x-ads-force`` parameter to ``true``, which deletes the existing manifest and creates a fresh manifest. However, if you do so, all derivatives generated prior to this are deleted.

#### Parameters
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/x-ads-force`
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/x-ads-derivative-format`

#### Request Body
- Required: `False`
- Content-Type: `application/json`

### Specify References

**Endpoint:** `POST /modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/references`
**Operation ID:** `specify-references`

#### Description
Specifies the location of the files referenced by the specified source design.

If a source design contains references to other files, you must set  ``checkReferences`` to ``true``, when you call `Submit Translation Job </en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/job-POST>`_.  The Model Derivative service will then use the details you specify in this operation to locate and download the referenced files.

#### Request Body

### Create Bucket

**Endpoint:** `POST /oss/v2/buckets`
**Operation ID:** `create_bucket`

#### Description
Creates a bucket. 

Buckets are virtual container within the Object Storage Service (OSS), which you can use to store and manage objects (files) in the cloud. The application creating the bucket is the owner of the bucket.

**Note:** Do not use this operation to create buckets for BIM360 Document Management. Use [POST projects/{project_id}/storage](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-storage-POST>) instead. For details, see [Upload Files to BIM 360 Document Management](/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/document-management/upload-document).

#### Parameters
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/x-ads-region`

#### Request Body
- Required: `True`
- Content-Type: `application/json`
  - Schema: `#/components/schemas/create_buckets_payload`

#### Responses
- **200**: Bucket was successfully created.
- **409**: The specified bucket key already exists.

---

### Delete Bucket

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /oss/v2/buckets/{bucketKey}`
**Operation ID:** `delete_bucket`

#### Description
Deletes the specified bucket. Only the application that owns the bucket can call this operation. All other applications that call this operation will receive a "403 Forbidden" error. 

The initial processing of a bucket deletion request can be time-consuming. So, we recommend only deleting buckets containing a few objects, like those typically used for acceptance testing and prototyping. 

**Note:** Bucket keys will not be immediately available for reuse.

#### Parameters
- `bucketKey` in `path` (required: True) — The bucket key of the bucket to delete.

#### Responses
- **200**: The bucket deletion request was accepted.
- **400**: BAD REQUEST, Invalid request due to malformed syntax or missing headers
- **404**: NOT FOUND, The specified ``bucketKey`` does not exist.
- **409**: CONFLICT, The specified bucket is already marked for deletion.

---

### Get Bucket Details

**Endpoint:** `GET /oss/v2/buckets/{bucketKey}/details`
**Operation ID:** `get_bucket_details`

#### Description
Returns detailed information about the specified bucket.

**Note:** Only the application that owns the bucket can call this operation. All other applications that call this operation will receive a "403 Forbidden" error.

#### Parameters
- `bucketKey` in `path` (required: True) — The bucket key of the bucket to query.

#### Responses

### Generate OSS Signed URL

**Endpoint:** `POST /oss/v2/buckets/{bucketKey}/objects/{objectKey}/signed`
**Operation ID:** `create_signed_resource`

#### Description
Generates a signed URL that can be used to download or upload an object within the specified expiration time. If the object the signed URL points to is deleted or expires before the signed URL expires, the signed URL will no longer be valid.

In addition to this operation that generates OSS signed URLs, OSS provides operations to generate S3 signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

Only the application that owns the bucket containing the object can call this operation.

#### Parameters

- Ref: `#/components/parameters/objectKey`
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/access`
- `useCdn` in `query` (required: False) — ``true`` : Returns a Cloudfront URL to the object instead of an Autodesk URL (one that points to a location on https://developer.api.autodesk.com). Applications can interact with the Cloudfront URL exactly like with any classic public resource in OSS. They can use GET requests to download objects or PUT requests to upload objects.

``false`` : (Default) Returns an Autodesk URL (one that points to a location on https://developer.api.autodesk.com) to the object.

#### Request Body
- Required: `False`
- Content-Type: `application/json`
  - Schema: `#/components/schemas/create_signed_resource`

#### Responses

**Operation ID:** `upload_signed_resource`

#### Description
Replaces an object that already exists on OSS, using an OSS signed URL. 

The signed URL must fulfil the following conditions:

- The signed URL is valid (it has not expired as yet).
- It was generated with ``write`` or ``readwrite`` for the ``access`` parameter.

#### Parameters
- `Content-Type` in `header` (required: False) — The MIME type of the object to upload; can be any type except 'multipart/form-data'. This can be omitted, but we recommend adding it.

### Generate Signed S3 Download URL

**Endpoint:** `GET /oss/v2/buckets/{bucketKey}/objects/{objectKey}/signeds3download`
**Operation ID:** `signed_s3_download`

#### Description
Gets a signed URL to download an object directly from S3, bypassing OSS servers. This signed URL expires in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start the download before the signed URL expires. The download itself can take longer. If the download fails after the validity period of the signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain a fresh signed URL.

Only applications that have read access to the object can call this operation.   

You can use range headers with the signed download URL to download the object in chunks. This ability lets you download chunks in parallel, which can result in faster downloads.

If the object you want to download was uploaded in chunks and is still assembling on OSS, you will receive multiple S3 URLs instead of just one. Each URL will point to a chunk. If you prefer to receive a single URL, set the ``public-resource-fallback`` query parameter to ``true``. This setting will make OSS fallback to returning a single signed OSS URL, if assembling is still in progress. 

In addition to this operation that generates S3 signed URLs, OSS provides an operation to generate OSS signed URLs. S3 signed URLs allow direct upload/download from S3 but are restricted to bucket owners. OSS signed URLs also allow upload/download and can be configured for access by other applications, making them suitable for sharing objects across applications.

#### Parameters
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/bucketKey`
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/objectKey`
- `If-None-Match` in `header` (required: False) — The last known ETag value of the object. OSS returns the signed URL only if the ``If-None-Match`` header differs from the ETag value of the object on S3. If not, it returns a 304 "Not Modified" HTTP status.
- `If-Modified-Since` in `header` (required: False) — A timestamp in the HTTP date format (Mon, DD Month YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT). The signed URL is returned only if the object has been modified since the specified timestamp. If not, a 304 (Not Modified) HTTP status is returned.
- `x-ads-acm-scopes` in `header` (required: False) — Optional OSS-compliant scope reference to increase bucket search performance
- `response-content-type` in `query` (required: False) — The value of the Content-Type header you want to receive when you download the object using the signed URL. If you do not specify a value, the Content-Type header defaults to the value stored with OSS.
- `response-content-disposition` in `query` (required: False) — The value of the Content-Disposition header you want to receive when you download the object using the signed URL. If you do not specify a value, the Content-Disposition header defaults to the value stored with OSS.
- `response-cache-control` in `query` (required: False) — The value of the Cache-Control header you want to receive when you download the object using the signed URL. If you do not specify a value, the Cache-Control header defaults to the value stored with OSS.
- `public-resource-fallback` in `query` (required: False) — Specifies how to return the signed URLs, in case the object was uploaded in chunks, and assembling of chunks is not yet complete.

- ``true`` : Return a single signed OSS URL.
- ``false`` : (Default) Return multiple signed S3 URLs, where each URL points to a chunk.
- `minutesExpiration` in `query` (required: False) — The time window (in minutes) the signed URL will remain usable. Acceptable values = 1-60 minutes. Default = 2 minutes.

**Tip:** Use the smallest possible time window to minimize exposure of the signed URL.
- `useCdn` in `query` (required: False) — ``true`` : Returns a URL that points to a CloudFront edge location.

``false`` : (Default) Returns a URL that points directly to the S3 object.
- `redirect` in `query` (required: False) — Generates a HTTP redirection response (Temporary Redirect 307​) using the generated URL.

#### Responses
- **200**: A signed S3 URL was successfully generated.
- **304**: NOT MODIFIED, If-None-Match header matches the object ETag or object has not been modified since the If-Modified-Since date.
- **400**: BAD REQUEST, the request has missing or malformed parameters.
- **401**: UNAUTHORIZED, Invalid authorization header.
- **404**: NOT FOUND, Object or Bucket does not exist.

### Batch Generate Signed S3 Upload URLs

**Endpoint:** `POST /oss/v2/buckets/{bucketKey}/objects/batchsigneds3upload`
**Operation ID:** `batch_signed_s3_upload`

#### Description
Creates and returns signed URLs to upload a set of objects directly to S3. These signed URLs expire in 2 minutes by default, but you can change this duration if needed.  You must start uploading the objects before the signed URLs expire. The upload  itself can take longer.

Only the application that owns the bucket can call this operation. All other applications that call this operation will receive a "403 Forbidden" error.

If required, you can request an array of signed URLs for each object, which lets you upload the objects in chunks. Once you upload all chunks you must call the [Complete Batch Upload to S3 Signed URL](/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-batchcompleteupload-POST/) operation to indicate completion. This instructs OSS to assemble the chunks and reconstitute the object on OSS. You must call this operation even if you requested a single signed URL for an object.

If an upload fails after the validity period of a signed URL has elapsed, you can call this operation again to obtain fresh signed URLs. However, you must use the same ``uploadKey`` that was returned when you originally called this operation.

#### Parameters
- Ref: `#/components/parameters/bucketKey`
- `useAcceleration` in `query` (required: False) — ``true`` : (Default) Generates a faster S3 signed URL using Transfer Acceleration.

``false``: Generates a standard S3 signed URL.
- `minutesExpiration` in `query` (required: False) — The time window (in minutes) the signed URL will remain usable. Acceptable values = 1-60 minutes. Default = 2 minutes.

**Tip:** Use the smallest possible time window to minimize exposure of the signed URL.

#### Request Body

## Secure Service Account (SSA)

_Generated from `ssa.yaml`_

APIs to manage Service accounts and keys. 

A service account is an identity that an application can use to make API requests to other services without a user authorizing the requests. A service account is identified by a unique email address and has an Oxygen ID.

A service account has one or more private keys. A private key is generated through an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; the paired public key is stored by Autodesk Identity.

An application can use a service account's private key to generate a JWT token. The JWT token provides proof of implicit authentication and authorization for this service account; an application can exchange it for a three-legged access token for the service service.

General error response from APIs:
```
{
    "title:": "...",
    "detail": "..."
}
```

## Webhooks

_Generated from `webhooks.yaml`_

The Webhooks API enables applications to listen to APS events and receive notifications when they occur. When an event is triggered, the Webhooks service sends a notification to a callback URL you have defined.
You can customize the types of events and resources for which you receive notifications. For example, you can set up a webhook to send notifications when files are modified or deleted in a specified hub or project.
Below is quick summary of this workflow:
1. Identify the data for which you want to receive notifications.
2. Use the Webhooks API to create one or more hooks.
3. The Webhooks service will notify the webhook when there is a change in the data.

- [Secure Service Accounts Example for creating SA accounts, and generating 3LO access tokens in 3 languages (SSA)](https://developer.doc.autodesk.com/bPlouYTd/cloud-platform-ssa-docs-main-460369/ssa/v1/tutorials/getting-started-with-ssa/about-this-walkthrough.html)



This walkthrough demonstrates how to create a secure service account, provision that account, and obtain an access token using the service account.

The workflow representation of the steps are:

The following code snippets implement the REST API calls illustrated with cURL in this walkthrough:

### Create an SSA Robot Service Account

Install Python libraries and provide appropriate inputs before running the script.
